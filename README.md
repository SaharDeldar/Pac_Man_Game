# PacMan
Pac-Man originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released by Namco for arcades.
In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. 
The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. 
Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.
Game development began in early 1979, directed by Toru Iwatani with a nine-man team.
Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time had themes of war or sports.
[citation needed] Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was the image of a pizza with a slice removed,
Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (Japanese: Âè£).
The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players.
The original Japanese title of Puck Man was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape; 
the title was changed for the North American release to mitigate vandalism.
Pac-Man was a widespread critical and commercial success, leading to several sequels, merchandise, and two television series,
as well as a hit single by Buckner & Garcia. The character of Pac-Man is now the mascot and flagship icon of Bandai Namco Entertainment. 
The franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling games,
generating more than $14 billion in revenue (as of 2016) and 43 million units in sales combined,
and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy, commonly listed as one of the greatest video games of all time.
